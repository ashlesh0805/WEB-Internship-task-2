# To-Do List Web App

## Description
This project is a To-Do List Web Application built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript as part of my Web Development Internship (Task 2).

The application allows users to:
- Add new tasks to a pending list
- Mark tasks as completed (moves automatically to the Completed column)
- Uncheck completed tasks to move them back to pending
- Remove tasks permanently

It demonstrates DOM manipulation, event handling, and state management in JavaScript while maintaining a clean, responsive UI.

## Key Concepts
- DOM Selection and Manipulation
- Event Listeners and Handlers
- Dynamic Element Creation and Deletion
- Class Toggling and State Updates

## Tools and Technologies
- HTML5 for structure
- CSS3 for styling and layout
- JavaScript (ES6) for logic and interactivity
- VS Code and Live Server for development

## UI Overview
The interface features two columns:
- Pending Tasks: newly added or active tasks
- Completed Tasks: tasks checked off by the user

It uses a white card-based design with a soft shaded background for a professional appearance.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project folder in VS Code.
3. Run using Live Server or open index.html directly in a browser.
